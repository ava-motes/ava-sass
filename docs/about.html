        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Harvey Dale</h3>
          <p>Harvey is our frontman — the foundation of the band, if you will. He got his start performing on the concrete steps outside of an abandoned warehouse, jamming out solo to his favorite radio tunes. But now that his air guitar days are over, he's here to mix up the music scene for good.</p>
        <h3>Mason Mortar</h3>
          <p>Mason is on bass, and his backstory is a mystery. Supposedly, the freemasons have sworn him to silence. All we're permitted to say is that he shreds. And he likes to cook, apparently.</p>
        <h3>Petra Plaster</h3>
          <p>Petra is our rock-solid drummer. She doesn't just keep time — she constructs it. When she's not hammering out a beat, you can find her at her pottery wheel or working on historical rennovation projects around town.</p>
